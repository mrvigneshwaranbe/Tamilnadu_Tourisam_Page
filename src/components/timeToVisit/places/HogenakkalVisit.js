            he best time to visit Hogenakkal is during the winter from October -
            February to relax and unwind near the waterfalls. Winters in
            Hogenekkal is pleasant with moderate weather throughout the day.
            Whereas the summers are warm and sunny with temperatures ranging
            from 23 - 34 degree celcius. Despite summers being an off season, a
            dip in the hogenekkal lake is rejuvenating for all. Monsoon on the
            other hand has a pleasant weather with temperatures ranging from 13
            to 20 degree celcius, making it an ideal time to enjoy its
            spectacular beauty.

            Hogenakkal Falls, located on the border of Tamil Nadu and Karnataka,
            is one of the most scenic places to visit in the region. The
            waterfall is known as Hogenakkal, or "Smoky Rocks", because of the
            unique arrangement of the gigantic carbonated rocks that surround
            it. The sight of River Kaveri splitting into multiple small streams
            and cascading from different heights ranging from 15 feet to 66 feet
            will leave you mesmerised! Hogenakkal Waterfall is similar to the
            popular.

              Watch the glory of nature take over Hogenakkal, as the south-west
              monsoon showers the region with about 150 mm of rainfall between
              these months. Hogenakkal is a sight to behold in the rain, as the
              Kaveri comes alive and usually floods her banks. While adventure
              enthusiasts and adrenaline junkies throng Hogenakkal in the
              monsoon, it is not recommended for tourists as the currents are
              too strong to swim in. Boating is not allowed either, and there is
              no standard means of transportation to reach the waterfalls. It is
              best to avoid the river, as the water flow may be too heavy.
              Further downhill, you can go rafting if you prefer, although
              discretion is advised. The waterfalls are a sight to behold, as
              they live up to their name of the 'Smoking Rocks' - the sultry
              mist as the water strikes the rocks covers the base in a myriad of
              colours. Rainbows adorn the falls and the scene is
              postcard-perfect.

              The Indian Peninsula lies in the tropics, and is known for its
              sweltering summer heat. Temperatures soar to a maximum of 35Â°C in
              April, which is the hottest month of the year here. The water flow
              is minimal, and there are few waterfalls to reckon during these
              summer months. Most small waterfalls dry up. The rock facades are
              magnificent, though. The jagged rocks and steep gorges make for
              picture-perfect views, and have been featured in many films as
              well.
