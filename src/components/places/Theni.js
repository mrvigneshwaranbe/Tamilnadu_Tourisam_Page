              {" "}
              Located in Dindigul district near Theni in Tamil Nadu, Kumbakkarai
              Falls is a mesmerising waterfall that is situated at the foothills
              of the Kodaikanal hills. The water cascades down in two layers- at
              the first stage, the water collects at the rock boulders and
              recesses. And in the second stage, it falls down the layer of
              rocks. These recesses are named after wild animals like tiger,
              snake, elephant, cheetah etc.
            </p>
            <p style={{ textIndent: "5rem", textAlign: "justify" }}>
              Besides boasting of immense scenic beauty and the melodious
              tinkering of the gushing waters, the place also offers utter peace
              and tranquility. Also unlike most other waterfalls, Kumbakkarai
              Falls also offer shallow waters where tourists are welcomed to
              swim or to take a dip. The popular tourist spot is the most
              crowded during the rainy season when the water level is high and
              the neighboring areas glows with greenery.
