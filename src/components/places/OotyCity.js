              peak, the Government Botanical Garden is a splendid garden in
              Udhagamandalam, near Coimbatore in the state of Tamil Nadu.

              several sections that are trimmed beautifully to present an
              endearing sight.

            <p style={{ textIndent: "5rem", textAlign: "justify" }}>
              Visitors are greeted with astounding colourful natural beauty from
              the moment they pass through the gates. For more than 160 years,
              foreign and local travellers have visited the lush green lawns of
              the garden, admiring the stunning variety of flowers, ferns, and
              orchids present here. Another highlight of the Botanical Garden is

            Emerald Lake is situated in Emerald Village, around 20-22 kilometres
            from the main city of Ooty and is a part of the Silent Valley
            National Park in the Nilgiris District. Serene and away from the
            maddening crowd, the lake and its surroundings are much cleaner and
            offer a perfect place to enjoy a leisurely time in the vicinity of
            nature and quietude.
          </p>
          <p style={{ textIndent: "5rem", textAlign: "justify" }}>
            It is one of the unexplored and virgin places of the South Indian
            hill station, not yet encroached by the masses of tourists that
            visit the place every year. Emerald Lake is the ideal spot in Ooty
            for nature lovers. Tourists usually flock there for the picturesque
            scenic beauty of the lake, and the green Nilgiri slopes and tea
            plantations surrounding it. It is a paradise for nature photography
            enthusiasts as the delightful landscape offers a perfect subject and
            composition.

              Blue Mountains). The gigantic rock formation is entirely
              unprecedented. There are enormous canyons found on both the sides
              of the destination and there is a clear view of the Catherine
              Falls, another popular tourist destination with its ongoing
              current several thousand meters below, which is located at a short
