            <p style={{ textIndent: "5rem", textAlign: "justify" }}>
              Situated in the 'Princess of Hill stations', Kodaikanal, the
              Pillar Rocks have become a lovely picnic spot. Constituting a
              beautiful mini garden; the place is named so as it has three
              vertically positioned boulders reaching up to a height of 400
              feet. The aura here is full of affection and is evidence of a
              great love story. The 'white cross' which once existed on these
              rocks represented David Gell's excellent tribute to love. The view
              of rocks is not something to be missed. They stand as an untouched
              miracle for the tourists visiting Kodaikanal.
            </p>
            <p style={{ textIndent: "5rem", textAlign: "justify" }}>
              The pillars are famous for providing bird's view of nearby
              surroundings. The chambers between these two massive rocks are
              called the Devil's Kitchen. Fewer times you might find rocks
              covered with mist and clouds, but when the ways become clear
              nothing beautiful than this could be ever seen.
