          <p style={{ textIndent: "5rem", textAlign: "justify" }}>
            Situated in the city of Chennai in Tamil Nadu, Marina Beach is a
            natural urban beach along the Bay of Bengal. The beach is stretched
            out to a distance of 13 kilometres making it the longest natural
            urban beach in the country, second largest in the world and also the
            most crowded beach in India with almost 30,000 visitors a day.
          </p>
          <p style={{ textIndent: "5rem", textAlign: "justify" }}>
            With a white sandy shore that looks as though extending to infinity,
            the landscape of Marina Beach is a mesmerising and serene sight to
            behold. The beach has a primarily sandy terrain and is dotted with
            plenty of merry-go-rounds and shops selling souvenirs. You could
            take a walk along the Marina beach with your near and dear ones or
            even all alone and enjoy the cool evening sea breeze along with a
            hot plate of crispy sundal and murukku. Watching the sun crawl
            upwards into the sky or even disappear into the ocean from the
            beach, is an awe-striking and enchanting experience.
